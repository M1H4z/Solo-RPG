# üìù Solo RPG ‚Äì Prioritized Project Checklist

---

## 1. Foundation & Structure (High Priority)

- [x] **Refactor folder structure**
  - [x] Add `/solana` for blockchain logic (wallet, NFT, SPL token)
  - [x] Add `/game` for Phaser.js and game engine logic
  - [x] Add `/marketplace` for trading UI and logic
  - [x] Add `/services/blockchain` for blockchain service abstraction
  - [x] Add `/services/marketplace` for marketplace service logic
  - [x] Add `/assets` for game assets (sprites, tilemaps, audio, images)
- [x] **Clean up obsolete files** and ensure code is grouped by feature
- [x] **Update README and onboarding docs** to reflect new structure and vision

---

## 2. Blockchain Integration (High Priority)

- [x] **Integrate `@solana/wallet-adapter`** for wallet connection (Phantom, Solflare, etc.)
- [x] **Add wallet connect UI** and store wallet address in user profile (Supabase)
  - [x] UI: wallet address is only shown in the button, not below
- [ ] **Integrate `@solana/web3.js` and Metaplex** for NFT minting and management
- [ ] **Scaffold SPL token logic** (mint, transfer, balance check)
- [ ] **Update Supabase schema** for wallet addresses, NFT claims, and token balances
- [x] **Audit and confirm Solana provider setup follows best practices**
  - [x] Note: Magic Eden/extension provider warning is caused by browser extensions, not app code. Current setup is robust and production-ready for wallet connection.
