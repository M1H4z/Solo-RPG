# Solo RPG Project - Comprehensive Checklist

This checklist tracks the overall project status, prioritizing foundational work, core gameplay, blockchain integration, and future enhancements.

---

## 1. Foundation & Structure (High Priority)

- [x] **Refactor and Finalize Folder Structure**
  - [x] Ensure `/src/app` for Next.js routing and API
  - [x] Ensure `/src/components` for UI components (auth, combat, game, hunters, inventory, ui, etc.)
  - [x] Ensure `/src/constants` for game data (classes, skills, items)
  - [x] Ensure `/src/lib` for core logic (combat, game utils, Supabase, stats)
  - [x] Ensure `/src/services` for backend service abstractions
  - [x] Add `/src/solana` for blockchain logic (wallet provider)
  - [ ] Consider `/src/game` for future Phaser.js or game engine logic (currently empty)
  - [ ] Consider `/src/marketplace` for future trading UI and logic
  - [x] Ensure `/src/assets` for static game assets (sprites, images - currently in `/public`)
  - [x] Ensure `supabase/` for migrations and schema
- [x] **Core Technical Setup**
  - [x] Next.js Project Setup
  - [x] TypeScript Integration
  - [x] Supabase Integration (Client & Server)
  - [x] TailwindCSS for Styling
  - [x] Shadcn/ui for UI Components (Button, Card, Input, Select, etc.)
  - [x] ESLint and Prettier for Code Quality
  - [x] Database Schema Design (Initial - `database.types.ts` generated)
  - [x] Environment Variable Management (`.env`)
- [x] **Clean up obsolete files** and ensure code is grouped by feature
- [x] **Update README and onboarding docs** to reflect current structure and vision (Partially done, can always be improved)

---

## 2. Blockchain Integration (High Priority)

- [x] **Integrate `@solana/wallet-adapter`** for wallet connection
  - [x] Wallet Connection Setup (`@/solana/WalletProvider.tsx`)
  - [x] Wallet Connect Button (`WalletConnectButton.tsx`) on Dashboard
- [x] **Add wallet connect UI** and basic display
  - [x] UI: wallet address is only shown in the button
  - [ ] Store wallet address in user profile (Supabase) - (Design: Needs schema update and API)
- [ ] **Integrate `@solana/web3.js` and Metaplex** for NFT minting and management (Future)
- [ ] **Scaffold SPL token logic** (mint, transfer, balance check) (Future)
  - [ ] Relates to Diamond (premium currency) for potential on-chain representation
- [ ] **Update Supabase schema** for wallet addresses, NFT claims, and token balances (Future)
- [x] **Audit and confirm Solana provider setup follows best practices**
  - [x] Note: Magic Eden/extension provider warning is caused by browser extensions, not app code. Current setup for wallet connection is robust.
- [ ] **Define NFT Metadata Standards** (For consistency of minted items)
- [ ] **Implement On-Chain/Off-Chain Data Synchronization Strategy**
  - [ ] Design mint/trade/equip triggers for dual updates (Supabase + Solana)
  - [ ] Plan scheduled jobs/webhooks for state reconciliation

---

## 3. Game Engine & Core Gameplay (High Priority)

- [ ] **Modularize and integrate Phaser.js** for dungeon navigation and combat (Future - currently using React components)
- [ ] **Refactor dungeon and combat logic** to use Phaser for visuals/interactions (Future)
- [x] **Organize all game assets** (Currently in `/public`, consider centralizing in `/src/assets`)
